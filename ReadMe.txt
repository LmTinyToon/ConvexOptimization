This repository contains exploration of S. Boyd and L. Vandenberghe's "Convex optimization" book.
Basically, I want to keep software implementations of optimization problems here.
Also solutions of book's exercises will be stored here. Unfortunately this draft does not contain header of tasks, it contains only solutions. 
There is book in free access (see  stanford site).
